The `dataset_path` should be the path to the directory where your dataset is stored on your local system or server. This directory should contain subdirectories, each representing a class (e.g., 'real' and 'fake'). Each of these subdirectories should contain the images for that class.

Here's an example of how your directory structure might look:

```
/path_to_your_dataset/
    /real/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
    /fake/
        image1.jpg
        image2.jpg
        ...
```

In this example, `/path_to_your_dataset/` is the path you would provide as `dataset_path`. The `real` and `fake` subdirectories contain the images for each class.

Please replace `/path_to_your_dataset/` with the actual path to your dataset. For example, if your dataset is stored in a folder named `deepfake_dataset` on your desktop, the `dataset_path` would be something like `C:/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/deepfake_dataset/` on Windows or `/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/deepfake_dataset/` on MacOS or Linux.

Remember, the path will depend on where you've stored the data on your local system or server. If you're not sure how to find the path, you can usually right-click on the folder and look for an option like "Properties" or "Get Info" to find the full path. Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
